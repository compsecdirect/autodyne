# Autodyne: Automated Firmadyne by CompSec Direct

## Purpose

Improve Firmadyne (https://github.com/firmadyne/firmadyne) and make it simpler to extract, emulate firmware for analysis.  

## Usage

1. Get firmware samples to analyze. ```mkdir samples samples-output``` Add firmware to ```samples``` folder
2. Edit the ```docker-compose.yml``` to include the desired "Manufacturer name" (can be anything) and path to samples.  
a. ```command``` section has  "foo", "1.bin" ; this is the "Manufacturers Name" and file name.  
b. ```volumes``` section has path to firmware samples and mapping to local images.  
3. Copy the relevant sections multiple times (given x samples).  
a. copy section from ```emulator-1``` until next entry.   
b. manually increment the desired ip address.  
4. ```make build and make start```  
5. ```docker exec CONTAINERID bash```  
6. ```tmux ls```  
7. ```tmux a -t "ImageID X"```  Where X is the database id generated by firmadyne.  
a. This tmux session is the console session to the firmware sample.

## Notes

0. main branch is ubuntu 18.04 / dev branch is ubuntu 20.04 base images.  

1. If you did not get a tmux session; a failure occurred during the seven firmadyne steps. We keep a ```samples-out``` folder to collect and debug emulation efforts.  
bin-extractor-output  
bin-getArch-output  
bin-inferNetwork-output  
bin-makeImage-output
2. The standalone autodyne container launched does the db init on the postgres container. The autodyne-em1, autodyne-em2, etc, are the containers that are attempting to emulate samples.
